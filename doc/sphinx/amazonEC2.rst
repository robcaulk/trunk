Using YADE with cloud computing on Amazon EC2
=============================================

(Note: we thank Robert Caulk for preparing and sharing this guide)

Summary
=======

This guide is intended to help YADE users migrate their simulations to
Amazon Web Service (AWS) EC2. Two of the most notable benefits of using
scalable cloud computing for YADE include decreased upfront cost and
increased productivity. The entire process, from launching an instance,
to installing YADE, to running a YADE simulation on the cloud can be
executed in under 5 minutes. Once the EC2 instance is running, you can
submit YADE scripts the same way you would submit jobs on a local
workstation.

Launching an EC2 instance
=========================

	Amazon Web Services (AWS) Console


Start by signing into the console on `Amazon
EC2 <https://aws.amazon.com/?nc2=h_lgl>`__. This will require an
existing or new Amazon account. Once you’ve signed in, you should find
the EC2 console by clicking on ‘services’ in the upper left hand corner
of the AWS homepage. Start by clicking on the \`\`launch an instance“
blue button (Fig. `fig-console`_). Select the Amazon
Machine Image (AMI): \`\`Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS\`\` (Fig.
`fig-ubuntu`_).

.. _fig-ubuntu:
.. figure:: fig/ubunut.*
	:scale: 60 %
	:align: center

	Select Ubuntu server 16.04 LTS AMI

You will now select the instance type. It is worth looking at the
`specifications for each of the
instances <https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/>`__ so you can
properly select the power you need for you YADE simulation. This
document will not go into detail in the selection of size, but you can
find plenty of `YADE specific performance
reports <https://yade-dem.org/publi/1stWorkshop/booklet.pdf>`__ that
will help you decide. However, the instance type is an important
selection. The \`\`Compute Optimized" instances are necessary for most
YADE simulations because they provide access to high performing
processors and guaranteed computing power. The C3.2xlarge (Fig.
`fig-type`_) is equivalent to an 8 core 2.8ghz Xeon E5
with 25 mb of cache, which is likely the best option for medium-large
scale YADE simulations.

Before launching, you will be asked to \`\`select an existing key pair
or create a new key pair". Create a new one, download it, and place it
in a folder that you know the path to. Modify the permissions on the
file by navigating to the same directory in the terminal and typing:

::

	chmod 400 KeyPair.pem

Now the instance is launched, you will need to connect to it via SSH. On
unix systems this is as easy as typing:

::

	ssh -i path/to/KeyPair.pem ubuntu@ec2-XX-XXX-XX-XX.us-west-2.compute.amazon.com

into the terminal. There are other options such as using PuTTY, or even
a java based terminal on the AWS website. You can find the necessary
information by navigating to \`\`Instances" in the left menu of the AWS
console. Right click on the instance as shown in Fig.
`fig-connect`_ and click connect.

You will be presented with the public DNS, which should look something
like Fig. `fig-dns`_.

Installing YADE and managing files
==================================

After you’ve connected to the instance through SSH, you will need to
install YADE. The following commands should be issued to install
yadedaily, python, and some other useful tools:

::

	#install yadedaily
	sudo bash -c 'echo "deb http://www.yade-dem.org/packages/ xenial/" >> /etc/apt/sources.list'
	wget -O - http://www.yade-dem.org/packages/yadedev_pub.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install -y yadedaily

	# install python
	sudo apt-get -y install python
	sudo apt-get -y install python-pip python-dev build-essential

	# install htop
	sudo apt-get -y install htop

| Note that \`\`..packages/ xenial/" should match the Ubuntu
distribution. 16.04 LTS is Xenial, but if you chose to start Ubuntu
14.04, you will need to change ‘xenial’ to ‘trusty’.

Finally, you will need to upload the necessary YADE files. If you have a
folder with the contents of your simulation titled \`\`yadeSimulation"
you can upload the folder and its contents by issuing the following
command:

::

	scp -r -i path/to/KeyYADEbox.pem path/to/yadeSimulation ubuntu@ec2-XX-XXX-XX-XX.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:~/yadeSimulation

You should now be able to run your simulation by changing to the proper
directory and typing:

::

	yadedaily nameOfSimulation.py

In order to retrieve the output files (folder titled ‘out’ below) for
post processing purposes, you will use the same command that you used to
upload the folder, but the remote and local file destinations should be
reversed:

::

	scp -r -i path/to/KeyYADEbox.pem ubuntu@ec2-XX-XXX-XX-XX.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:~/yadeSimulation/out/ path/to/yadeSimulation/out

Plotting output in the terminal
===============================

One of the main issues encountered with cloud computing is the lack of
graphical feedback. There is an easy solution for graphically checking
the status of your simulations which makes use of gnuplot’s wonderful
‘terminal dumb’ feature. Any data can be easily plotted by navigating to
the subfolder where the simulation is saving its output and typing:

::

	gnuplot
	set terminal dumb
	plot ``data.txt" using 1:2 with lines

Where ‘1:2’ refers to the columns in data.txt that you wish to plot
against one another. Your output should look something like this:

.. figure:: fig/gnuplot.*

Comments
========

-  Amazon AWS allows you to stop your instance and restart it again
   later with the same files and package installations. If you wish to
   create several instances that all contain the same installation and
   file directory you can create a snapshot of your default image which
   you will be able to use to create various volumes that you can attach
   to new instances. These actions are all performed very easily and
   graphically through the EC2 console

-  You can use Spot Instances, which are a special type of instance that
   allow you to bid on unused servers. The price is heavily discounted
   and worth looking into for any YADE user that wishes to run hundreds
   of hours of simulations.

-  For most simulations, your computational efficiency will decrease if
   you use :math:`\textgreater` 8 cores per simulation. It is preferable
   to use yadedaily-batch to distribute your cores accordingly so that
   you always dedicate 8 cores to each simulation and ensure 100% of the
   processor is running.

-  Create a tmux session to avoid ending YADE simulations upon
   disconnecting from the server.

::

      tmux  # starts a new session
      tmux attach -t 0  # attach session 0
      tmux kill -t 0  # kill session
      ## cntrl - b - d to move back to home
      ## cntrl - b - [ to navigate within the session
