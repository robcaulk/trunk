	YADE_CLASS_BASE_DOC_ATTRS_CTOR_PY(HydroForceEngine,PartialEngine,"Apply drag and lift due to a fluid flow vector (1D) to each sphere + the buoyant weight.\n The applied drag force reads\n\n $F_{d}=\\frac{1}{2} C_d A\\rho^f|\\vec{v_f - v}| \\vec{v_f - v}$ \n\n where $\\rho$ is the medium density (:yref:`densFluid<HydroForceEngine.densFluid>`), $v$ is particle's velocity,  $v_f$ is the velocity of the fluid at the particle center(:yref:`vxFluid<HydroForceEngine.vxFluid>`),  $A$ is particle projected area (disc), $C_d$ is the drag coefficient. The formulation of the drag coefficient depends on the local particle reynolds number and the solid volume fraction. The formulation of the drag is [Dallavalle1948]_ [RevilBaudard2013]_ with a correction of Richardson-Zaki [Richardson1954]_ to take into account the hindrance effect. This law is classical in sediment transport. It is possible to activate a fluctuation of the drag force for each particle which account for the turbulent fluctuation of the fluid velocity (:yref:`velFluct<HydroForceEngine.velFluct>`). The model implemented for the turbulent velocity fluctuation is a simple discrete random walk which takes as input the Reynolds stress tensor $R^f_{xz}$ as a function of the depth, and allows to recover the main property of the fluctuations by imposing $<u_x'u_z'> (z) = <R^f_{xz}>(z)/\\rho^f$. It requires as input $<R^f_{xz}>(z)/\\rho^f$ called :yref:`simplifiedReynoldStresses<HydroForceEngine.simplifiedReynoldStresses>` in the code. \n The formulation of the lift is taken from [Wiberg1985]_ and is such that : \n\n $F_{L}=\\frac{1}{2} C_L A\\rho^f((v_f - v)^2_{top} - (v_f - v)^2_{bottom})$ \n\n Where the subscript top and bottom means evaluated at the top (respectively the bottom) of the sphere considered. This formulation of the lift account for the difference of pressure at the top and the bottom of the particle inside a turbulent shear flow. As this formulation is controversial when approaching the threshold of motion [Schmeeckle2007]_ it is possible to desactivate it with the variable :yref:`lift<HydroForceEngine.lift>`.\n The buoyancy is taken into account through the buoyant weight : \n\n $F_{buoyancy}= - \\rho^f V^p g$ \n\n, where g is the gravity vector along the vertical, and $V^p$ is the volume of the particle. This engine also evaluate the average particle velocity, solid volume fraction and drag force depth profiles, through the function averageProfile. This is done as the solid volume fraction depth profile is required for the drag calculation, and as the three are required for the independent fluid resolution.",
